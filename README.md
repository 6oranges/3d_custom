# 3d_custom
Just a fun project to see what 3d libraries are up against. This project has code to read obj/mtl and 3mf files. It implements a 3d renderer from scratch using pygame for a display.
Supports textures and flat face coloring. Has a z-buffer to draw things pixel perfect. Runs at an amazing 1fps. Don't use this for performance reasons, or any reason really, just an
experiment.
